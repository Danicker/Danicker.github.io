        <h1>Wiki</h1>
        <p>This is The World's Hardest Game Wiki. Currently it only contains the Glitch List, but this will be expanded later. A big thanks to Fraims for writing the glitch list.</p>

        <h2>Glitch List</h2>
        <p>
            The following is a list of all the glitches, exploits and oversights in the World’s Hardest Game series. Note that we use the word "glitch" in a broad sense, not all of these are really glitches, some are just interesting edge cases in the game's behaviour. The list is sorted by categories based on importance, and then roughly ordered by game and first occurrence.

        <p>
            This category lists glitches that are likely to be encountered by a casual player, and can have negative consequences such as softlocking or losing progress. These glitches are useful to know about in order to avoid them.

                    If the game is opened while save data is not present (usually the first time the game is opened), then the “CONTINUE” checkpoint will always send you to the Level 1 tip screen, even after save data has been created. If you then proceed through the tips, your save data will be overwritten to the start of Level 1. To prevent this, close and reopen the game instead. If the game is opened while having save data, continuing will work normally.

                    Going to the main menu and continuing while having coins collected but not saved, will respawn the coins but cause the coin counter to decrement twice the amount that it should, although it can’t go below zero. If caught, it can be fixed by closing and reopening the game.

                    Pausing during a cutscene allows the player to die during a cutscene, which can lead to softlocks. Can also happen by respawning onto a cutscene in for example 4-D3. Fixed by simply loading the game. More information at <a href="#Cutscene_Death">cutscene death</a>.

                    Continuing during a level may cause the collision of a previously opened door to reappear, trapping the player. Seemingly rare and exclusive to the 1.0 version.

                <td>
                    On the 1.1 version, the WASD keys aren’t properly programmed in regards to ice acceleration and wall corners, making it impossible to move fast on ice or enter one tile gaps without the arrow keys. Fixed on the 1.2 version.

                <td>
                    Sometimes the games will not work correctly due to how flash is set up, for example not allowing it to save locally can cause a death loop in TWHG4.

            Lastly, while not a glitch, it’s possible to softlock in TWHG3 L4-A2 by getting to the checkpoint in the middle without having collected all the coins in the level. While it’s unlikely for a casual player to fall into this trap, it remains technically possible.

        <h3 id="Major_Glitches">Major Glitches</h3>
        <p>
            This category lists glitches that are relatively well known within the community, because they’re either applicable in most places, have major consequences, or are used in speedruns. Some of these are not considered glitches for the purposes of glitchless speedruns, and some of these are not allowed in any speedrun. This has been outlined in detail in the leaderboard rules.

                <td>
                    Due to how flash handles collision detection, enemy hitboxes become smaller as they move faster. Since the player hitbox consists of five (TWHG1) or nine pixels arranged in a grid, sometimes the enemy hitboxes can fit inside the player without colliding.

                <td>
                    By moving into a corner and continuing to hold the direction towards the wall, the player can partially clip into the wall. This is only possible to a lesser degree in TWHG2 because of an additional wall check.

                <td>
                    Following a wall clip, it’s possible to be pushed outward by a wall in the same direction as the player is moving, doubling the distance moved for one frame. In TWHG2, this is possible without a prior wall clip due to the altered player hitbox. In TWHG3 there are no wall clips, although corners will still push the player up to three additional pixels.

                    Changing the size of the window or the quality of the game will affect how the game is rendered, which in turn affects how collision detection is handled. While not exactly a glitch, it heavily affects wall clips and enemy clips.

                <td>
                    In TWHG1 and TWHG2, by making the game window very small, the enemy and wall hitboxes will not render and it’s possible to move through them. In TWHG3 and TWHG4, enemy hitboxes will disappear as well, although walls will still exist. However, in some cases it becomes possible to reach checkpoints early.

                <td>
                    Using this debug feature of flash, TWHG1 will act like an animation and quickly skip to the end screen. In TWHG2, it’s possible to skip levels, but it becomes impossible to beat any levels after doing this.

                <td>
                    Pausing the game on the same frame as hitting an enemy will prevent a death from occurring. By holding the pause button it’s possible, though inconsistent, to pause every frame and go through enemies.

                <td>
                    If you pause during a text screen (that isn’t preceded by a tip) the game will continue as normal, allowing the player to move while the game is paused. Hitting an enemy won’t trigger a death, but it will prevent the player from moving until the game is unpaused.

                    Upon getting a key or coin that triggers a cutscene of a door opening, the player will be invincible for ten frames before the cutscene starts. It’s possible to take advantage of this invincibility to go through enemies, though it’s more of an exploit than a glitch.

                <td>
                    Disabling and enabling autosaving while not on a checkpoint will save the game. If a new room is entered without touching a checkpoint inside it, savewarping can allow reaching checkpoints early and skipping coin doors. In TWHG4, savewarping will keep all collectibles, while in TWHG3 they will respawn, unless the game is closed and reopened.

                <td>
                    Savewarping during a tip screen will load the next tip screen, skipping the entire level. Attempting to skip Level 5 in this way will result in a glitched tip screen for level 6.

                <td>
                    By savewarping to an invalid checkpoint, the game will not be able to load properly, and the wall collision from the main menu will remain, as well as the player’s position and invincibility.

                    After main menu storage, it’s possible to load the wall collisions properly, as long as a checkpoint and regular key are accessible. This can allow the player to remain invincible while playing the level, until a cutscene is activated.

                    During a cutscene walk, the player is also able to die and interrupt the cutscene. Depending on circumstances the player will either respawn while the room is still in the cutscene state, respawn normally, or get stuck in a death loop.

                    Loading the game during a cutscene will spawn the player at the default position, the center of the screen. Depending on circumstances the player will either softlock, respawn normally, or be intangible. It's also possible to load into a different level, which can freeze the game.

                <td>
                    On certain resolutions larger than default size, some checkpoint hitboxes will extend slightly past a wall that normally covers it, making it possible to touch the checkpoints early and skip opening doors. One notable example is the final checkpoint in Level 4.

                <td>4</td>
                <td>
                    It’s possible to beat level 4 during a cutscene by getting a key after touching the final checkpoint. After this, starting or loading a new level will immediately trigger the level end screen. This can be applied to every level except 2, which will instead start with one of the results from a cutscene load.

            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>
            Lastly, while not a glitch, it’s possible to collect the paint in TWHG3 Level 4 after beating the level, as long as speech bubbles are enabled. This takes advantage of the invincibility after touching the final checkpoint and saves a lot of time over the intended path.

The coin door, similarly to the HUD, will display “8888 left”. If a cutscene load does not result in a softlock, it will trigger glitched player and coin door but not glitched HUD.

                    Depending on how many rooms you’ve visited in a level, some doors inside rooms with paints will lose their outline and take on the color of the wall, and eventually disappear entirely. This can be observed in Level 2, 3 and 4. The coin door in Level 4 is also affected. It doesn’t happen in Level 1 or 5, perhaps because those doors are opened with a cutscene.

                    On the right half of 5-B3, there is a misplaced enemy on the path to the coins that forces the player to move diagonally between a stationary and a moving enemy, which is possible but precise. There are many other misplaced enemies, but this one has the biggest consequences.

                    Many of the enemies in 5-D1 are desynced, making some patterns impossible for long periods of time. Additionally, one stationary enemy has been replaced with a coin, making the optional path required to beat the game.
