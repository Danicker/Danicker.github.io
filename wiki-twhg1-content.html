        <!--
        <p>The World’s Hardest Game is a Flash game developed by Stevie Critoph. <note>[Note: Although the official title is “The World’s Hardest Game”, it is commonly referred to as “The World’s Hardest Game 1” or “TWHG1” to avoid confusion with the sequels.]</note> The game was first sponsored by Armor Games and published to their site in ??year. (other hosts?). (flash version: 8?). Later, an update (unofficial???) was made to the game that included a level select option on the main menu. This was sponsored by Coolmathsgames and published to their site in ??year. (Other differences: Level select has black background). Except where stated otherwise, the information on this page applies to both versions.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The objective of the game is to complete the game's 30 levels.</p>

        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>In each level, the player <note>(a red square)</note> must avoid the enemies <note>(blue circles)</note>, collect all the coins <note>(yellow circles)</note>, and proceed to the finish checkpoint <note>(a green rectangle)</note>. There are also walls <note>(light blue)</note> that the player cannot pass through.</p>

        <h3>The Player</h3>
        <p>The player is a red square. <note>[Note: There is no option to change the player colour in TWHG1.]</note> The player can be moved using WASD or arrow keys. The player moves at a fixed speed of 3 pixels per frame. If the player is moving diagonally, it will move 3 pixels in each direction, meaning a total net distance of approximately 4.24 pixels.</p>
